General repository for ACS JCIM submission of the manuscript (ci-2022-00780y)

"Understanding the recognition mechanisms of a therapeutic Nanobody targeting the human prion protein using integrative structural biology data"

by Luca Mollica (UniMI) and Gabriele Giachin (UniPD). 

The repositories contain the following data:

     1  cs: chemical shifts computed (SPARTA+) from the 500 sampled structures for each trajectory (WT, E219K, V210I)
     2  reference_pdb: original PDB deposited for each PrP variant, starting structure of the MD simulations
     3  traj: complete trajectory (protein only) for each system analyzed in the manuscript (WT, E219K, V210I: the details are reported in the main text)
     4  traj_pdbs: PDB files corresponding to each frame used for sampling the ddistribution of the chemical shifts reported in the manuscript
